## CineScope Overview

**CineScope** is a full-stack movie discovery app where users can search for films, filter by genre, and save favourites using Airtable as a backend. It features a cinematic UI with skeleton loading, scroll-to-top behavior, and graceful empty state handling.

### The App Emphasizes:

- Accessibility: Clear genre filters and responsive design.
- User Experience: Smooth search, pagination, and feedback states.
- Modularity: Reusable components and scalable architecture.

CineScope was my way of practicing how to work with external APIs. Using TMDB to get movie data and Airtable to store favourites. It taught me how to handle responses, errors, and how to structure my code so itâ€™s easy to update later.
